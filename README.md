## 🤔 What is FiscalPilot?

FiscalPilot is the **first open-source AI CFO** — an autonomous agent that connects to your financial systems, understands your business, and takes action. Not just reports. Not just dashboards. An actual AI-powered Chief Financial Officer that can think, recommend, and — with your approval — **execute**.

### What your AI CFO does

- 📊 **Analyzes** — Scans every transaction, invoice, and account balance across all your systems
- 🧠 **Understands** — Applies Benford's Law, anomaly detection, industry benchmarks, and cash flow modeling
- 💡 **Recommends** — Surfaces specific, dollar-quantified opportunities with clear next steps
- ⚡ **Executes** — With your approval, takes action: categorizes expenses, pays bills, cancels subscriptions, files reports
- 🛡️ **Asks first** — Human-in-the-loop by default. Nothing happens without your say-so. You control the autonomy level.

### Built for every business — from one person to one thousand

Unlike tools that only serve tech startups or only serve enterprises, FiscalPilot adapts to **any business, any industry, any size**.

| 👤 Freelancer | 🍕 Restaurant | 🏥 Healthcare Practice | 💻 SaaS Startup | 🏗️ Construction Co | 🏭 Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-categorize expenses | Track food cost ratios | Manage insurance billing | Monitor burn rate | Track project costs | Multi-entity consolidation |
| Estimate quarterly taxes | Negotiate supplier prices | Flag compliance gaps | Optimize SaaS stack | Verify subcontractor invoices | Treasury optimization |
| Send invoice reminders | Schedule vendor payments | Reconcile patient payments | Recognize revenue (ASC 606) | Manage retainage | Global tax provisioning |
| Find missed deductions | Detect POS discrepancies | Verify CPT code billing | Calculate R&D tax credits | Benchmark material costs | Automated month-end close |

### 🔒 Privacy first. Open source forever.

FiscalPilot runs **entirely on your infrastructure**. Your financial data never leaves your systems. Use local LLMs (Ollama, vLLM) for complete privacy, or connect to any cloud provider. No vendor lock-in. No data harvesting. Apache 2.0 licensed.

> **Why open source matters for financial tools:** Closed-source SaaS products like Ramp, Stampli, and Vic.ai do great work — but they require you to upload your most sensitive data to someone else's cloud. FiscalPilot gives you the same capabilities with zero trust requirements.

## ⚡ Quickstart (For Developers)

### Install

```bash
pip install fiscalpilot
```

### Run your first analysis

```bash
# Quick scan from CSV — works in 60 seconds
fp scan --csv expenses.csv --company "My Business" --industry restaurant

# Full analysis with config file
fp audit --config fiscalpilot.yaml
```

### Use as a Python library

```python
import asyncio
from fiscalpilot import FiscalPilot
from fiscalpilot.models.company import CompanyProfile, Industry, CompanySize

company = CompanyProfile(
    name="Riverside Dental",
    industry=Industry.HEALTHCARE,
    size=CompanySize.SMALL,
    annual_revenue=800_000,
)

pilot = FiscalPilot.from_config("fiscalpilot.yaml")
report = asyncio.run(pilot.audit(company))

print(f"Identified {len(report.findings)} opportunities")
print(f"Potential savings: ${report.total_potential_savings:,.2f}")
print(f"Proposed actions: {len(report.proposed_actions)}")

# Review proposed actions before execution
for action in report.proposed_actions:
    print(f"  [{action.approval_level}] {action.title} — saves ${action.estimated_savings:,.2f}")

# Approve and execute (human-in-the-loop)
pilot.approve(action_ids=["act_001", "act_003"])
results = asyncio.run(pilot.execute_approved())
```

### Configuration

Create a `fiscalpilot.yaml`:

| **Delivery ROI** | DoorDash/UberEats vs dine-in margin analysis | "Is DoorDash actually worth it?" |
| **Square POS Integration** | Pull payments, menu items, daily summaries | "What happened at my registers today?" |

### Python Usage

```python
from fiscalpilot.agents.restaurant import create_restaurant_agent
from fiscalpilot.analyzers.menu_engineering import MenuEngineeringAnalyzer, MenuItemData
from fiscalpilot.analyzers.breakeven import BreakevenCalculator
from fiscalpilot.analyzers.tip_credit import TipCreditCalculator
from fiscalpilot.analyzers.delivery_roi import DeliveryROIAnalyzer, DeliveryOrderData

# Menu Engineering — find your Stars and Dogs
menu_items = [
    MenuItemData(name="Margherita Pizza", menu_price=16, food_cost=4, quantity_sold=450),
    MenuItemData(name="Truffle Pasta", menu_price=28, food_cost=12, quantity_sold=80),
    MenuItemData(name="House Salad", menu_price=8, food_cost=2.50, quantity_sold=300),
    MenuItemData(name="Lobster Tail", menu_price=55, food_cost=28, quantity_sold=25),
]
result = MenuEngineeringAnalyzer.analyze(menu_items)
print(f"Stars: {[i.name for i in result.stars]}")  # High profit, high sales
print(f"Dogs: {[i.name for i in result.dogs]}")    # Consider removing

# Break-even — how many covers do you need?
breakeven = BreakevenCalculator.calculate(
    fixed_costs=45000,      # Monthly rent, insurance, etc.
    variable_cost_pct=35,   # Food + labor as % of revenue
    avg_check=42,
)
print(f"Break-even: ${breakeven.breakeven_revenue:,.0f}/month ({breakeven.breakeven_covers} covers)")

# Tip Credit — are you claiming FICA credits?
from fiscalpilot.analyzers.tip_credit import TippedEmployee
employees = [
    TippedEmployee(name="Maria", hours_worked=160, tips_received=2800, cash_wage=2.13),
    TippedEmployee(name="Jake", hours_worked=140, tips_received=2100, cash_wage=2.13),
]
credit = TipCreditCalculator.calculate(employees, state="TX")
print(f"Monthly tip credit: ${credit.total_credit:,.2f}")
print(f"Annual projection: ${credit.annual_projection:,.2f}")

# Delivery ROI — is DoorDash worth it?
orders = [
    DeliveryOrderData(platform="doordash", gross_revenue=45, food_cost=12, order_count=150),
    DeliveryOrderData(platform="ubereats", gross_revenue=42, food_cost=11, order_count=80),
]
roi = DeliveryROIAnalyzer.analyze(orders, dine_in_margin=65)
for platform in roi.platforms:
    print(f"{platform.platform}: {platform.effective_margin:.1f}% margin (gap: {platform.margin_gap:+.1f}%)")
```

### Square POS Connection

```python
from fiscalpilot.connectors import SquarePOSConnector

connector = SquarePOSConnector(
    access_token="sq0atp-xxxxx",  # From Square Developer Dashboard
    sandbox=False,
)

# Pull all financial data
dataset = await connector.pull()

# Get daily summary
summary = await connector.get_daily_summary("2026-02-27")
print(f"Today: ${summary['gross_sales']:,.2f} gross, {summary['transaction_count']} txns")

# Get menu item sales
item_sales = await connector.get_item_sales(days_back=30)
for item in item_sales[:5]:
    print(f"  {item['name']}: {item['quantity_sold']} sold, ${item['total_revenue']:,.2f}")
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

FiscalPilot uses a **multi-agent architecture** with an **execution pipeline**. Agents don't just find opportunities — they propose specific actions, route them through approval, and execute them.

### Pipeline: Analyze → Propose → Approve → Execute

1. **Connectors** pull data from your financial systems (CSV, QuickBooks, Xero, SQL, Plaid, etc.)
2. **Intelligence Engines** run pure-computation analysis (no LLM needed):
   - 📐 **Benford's Law** — Chi-squared test, MAD scoring, per-vendor digit analysis
   - 📈 **Anomaly Detection** — Z-score, IQR, time-series deviation tracking
   - 🏭 **Industry Benchmarks** — Compare spend ratios against 13 industry profiles
   - 💰 **Cash Flow Forecast** — Exponential smoothing, runway, seasonal patterns
   - 🧾 **Tax Optimizer** — Miscategorized deductions, Section 179, entity structure
3. **Specialist Agents** run in parallel (LLM-powered):
   - 💡 **Cost Optimizer** — Finds savings in subscriptions, services, and operations
   - 🛡️ **Risk Detector** — Identifies anomalous payments, duplicate transactions, policy gaps
   - 📈 **Margin Optimizer** — Finds pricing and revenue mix improvements
   - 💰 **Revenue Analyzer** — Detects growth opportunities and billing gaps
   - 🏪 **Vendor Manager** — Audits vendor relationships, renegotiation opportunities
   - 🧾 **Tax Advisor** — Surfaces missed deductions, credits, and entity strategies
4. **Action Proposals** — Each finding generates specific, executable actions with dollar estimates
5. **Approval Gate** — You review and approve. Nothing executes without consent.
6. **Execution Engine** — Approved actions are carried out with dry-run preview, rollback capability, and complete audit trail

---

## ⚡ Execution Engine

> **Most financial tools stop at "here's what we found." FiscalPilot keeps going.**

The execution engine turns findings into actions. Instead of printing "you have a duplicate payment" and expecting you to fix it, FiscalPilot proposes: *"Cancel duplicate payment #4821 to Sysco Foods for $1,400. Mark original payment #4819 as retained. Notify AP team."*

### How it works

```python
# After analysis, review proposed actions
report = await pilot.audit(company)

for action in report.proposed_actions:
    print(f"""
    Action: {action.title}
    Type:   {action.action_type}
    Saves:  ${action.estimated_savings:,.2f}
    Level:  {action.approval_level}   # GREEN / YELLOW / RED / CRITICAL
    Steps:  {action.steps}
    """)

# Approve specific actions
pilot.approve(["act_001", "act_002", "act_005"])

# Execute with dry-run first
results = await pilot.execute(dry_run=True)   # Preview what would happen
results = await pilot.execute(dry_run=False)  # Actually do it

# Every action is logged immutably
for r in results:
    print(f"{r.action_id}: {r.status} — {r.summary}")
```

### Tiered Autonomy — You Control the Trust Level

Not all actions are equal. Categorizing an expense is low-risk. Canceling a subscription is significant. Changing payroll is critical. FiscalPilot uses **tiered autonomy** so you control exactly what happens automatically:

| Level | Risk | What happens | Examples |
|-------|------|--------------|----------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Low | Auto-executes silently | Categorize expense, tag transaction, generate report |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Medium | Executes, then notifies you | Send payment reminder, bulk-update categories, flag for review |
| 🔴 **Red** | High | Waits for your approval | Cancel subscription, pay invoice, contact vendor |
| ⚫ **Critical** | Very High | Requires multi-party approval | Modify payroll, change tax filing, large transfers |

You configure the autonomy level per action type. Start conservative (everything requires approval), then grant more trust as you see fit. **Progressive trust, not blind automation.**

### Built-in Safety

- **Dry-run mode** — Preview every action before it touches anything
- **Rollback capability** — Undo actions when possible (e.g., restore a category change)
- **Immutable audit trail** — Every action, approval, and execution is logged with timestamp, actor, and outcome
- **Rate limiting** — Prevent runaway execution (max actions per hour/day)
- **Scope boundaries** — Actions are sandboxed to their financial system; no lateral movement

---

## 🛡️ Human-in-the-Loop

FiscalPilot is built on a core principle: **AI proposes, humans decide.**

This isn't a checkbox feature — it's the architecture. Every action flows through an approval gate before execution. The system is designed so that:

1. **Nothing executes by default** — `require_approval: true` out of the box
2. **You see exactly what will happen** — Every proposed action shows the specific steps, affected accounts, and dollar impact
3. **You approve individually or in bulk** — Review each action, or approve a category of low-risk actions
4. **You can revoke trust** — Downgrade any action type's autonomy level at any time
5. **Everything is logged** — Full audit trail for compliance, tax, and peace of mind

### Approval Workflow

```
Finding: "Unused Slack subscription — 3 seats inactive for 6+ months"
    │
    ▼
Proposed Action: "Reduce Slack plan from 25 to 22 seats"
    │   Saves: $1,080/year
    │   Level: RED (requires approval)
    │   Steps:
    │     1. Log into Slack admin
    │     2. Deactivate seats: jsmith, mwilson, klee
    │     3. Downgrade plan from 25 → 22
    │     4. Confirm billing change
    │
    ▼
You: ✅ "Approved" / ❌ "Rejected" / ✏️ "Modify: keep klee, only remove 2"
    │
    ▼
Execution: Carries out approved version with full audit log
```

## 🌍 How FiscalPilot Compares

The financial AI landscape is evolving fast. Here's where FiscalPilot fits:

| Feature | FiscalPilot | Ramp | Stampli | Vic.ai | Docyt |
|---------|:-----------:|:----:|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Open source | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Self-hosted / data stays local | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-industry | ✅ | Finance only | AP only | AP only | Bookkeeping |
| Analysis engine | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Execution engine | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Human-in-the-loop | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Any LLM (local or cloud) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Custom agents/connectors | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Free | ✅ | Freemium | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**FiscalPilot is the only open-source project that combines financial analysis with execution capabilities.** Existing open-source agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) can build analysis agents, but none include financial execution, approval workflows, or industry-specific knowledge. That's our whitespace.

### Multi-LLM Support

FiscalPilot supports **any LLM provider** via [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm):

```yaml
# OpenAI
llm:
  model: "gpt-4o"

# Anthropic
llm:
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

# Local (Ollama) — 100% private
llm:
  model: "ollama/llama3.1:70b"

# Azure OpenAI
